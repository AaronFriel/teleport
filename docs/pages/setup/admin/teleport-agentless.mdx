title: How to Run Teleport Resource Services
description: How to run Teleport's resource services to manage access to your infrastructure.

Teleport manages access to resources in your cluster using **resource
services**, such as the SSH Service, Kubernetes Service, and Database Service.
This guide will the configurations you can use to run Teleport's resource
services within your cluster, including in **agentless mode** and in **agent
mode**.

In general, all of Teleport's resource services must run on the same _network_
as the resources they manage, but not on the same _host_. This means that you
have two options for deploying resource services, which we will introduce in
more detail in this guide:

{/* TODO: Add diagrams to explain each mode */}

- **Agentless mode:** You can deploy one resource service—or a small pool of
  resource services—in the same data center (or network) as your infrastructure.
  This minimizes the resource utilization of your resource services while
  reducing their capacity to handle client traffic.

  With Teleport in agentless mode, you can easily control access to SSH servers,
  Kubernetes clusters, databases and internal applications without running any
  additional software on your servers. Agentless mode supports session
  recordings and audit logs for deep understanding into user behavior.

- **Agent mode:** You can deploy a single `teleport` daemon within the same host
  or Kubernetes pod as the application, database, or other resource it protects.

  For capabilities such as kernel-level logging and user provisioning, we
  recommend Teleport as a drop-in replacement for OpenSSH. Since Teleport
  replaces the OpenSSH agent while preserving OpenSSH functionality, you get
  deeper analytics without a net addition of an agent on your system.

## Agentless mode

{/* TODO: Consider adding a section/sections re: deploying resource services on the same
host as the Auth/Proxy (or Auth without the Proxy and vice versa) */}

{/* TODO: How would a pool of resource services work? Are these services
stateless? If you deploy them behind a load balancer, would the load balancer
need to terminate TLS? */}

{/* How to make this work for each service */}
{/* RE: the SSH service, talk about running without a resource service */}

## Agent mode

the one that comes to mind */}
