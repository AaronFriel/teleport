With the latest release of Teleport comes new APT repos. These repos
allow for tigher control over what release channel and major version of
Teleport you install. If you've previously installed Teleport via the APT
repo at `https://deb.releases.teleport.dev/`, you can upgrade by
re-running the Debian/Ubuntu (DEB) install instructions below.

Don't want to upgrade? Not a problem. We'll be maintaining the APT repo at 
`https://deb.releases.teleport.dev/` for the foreseeable future.
