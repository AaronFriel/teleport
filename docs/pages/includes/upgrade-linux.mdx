With the latest release of Teleport we have added new APT repos. These repos
allow for tigher control over what release channel and major version of
Teleport you install. If you've previously installed Teleport via the APT
repo at `https://deb.releases.teleport.dev/`, you can upgrade by deleting 
the old APT source from your machines:

```code
rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/teleport.list
```

Not ready to upgrade? Not a problem. We will be maintaining the APT repo at 
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/teleport.list for the foreseeable future.
